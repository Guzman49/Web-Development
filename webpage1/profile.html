                <h2>Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán</h2>
                <h3>The rise and fall of one of the world's most notorious cartel leaders</h3>
                <p>Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán was born on April 4, 1957, in Badiraguato,
            Sinaloa, Mexico. Raised in a rural farming family, he later became
            one of the most powerful figures in international drug trafficking.</p>
                <p>Guzmán expanded his influence through the Sinaloa Cartel, building
            extensive international trafficking routes and becoming one of the
            most wanted individuals by global law enforcement agencies.</p>
                <p>Guzmán's activities had a significant impact on global drug
            trafficking and organized crime enforcement efforts. His story
            remains one of the most studied cases in modern criminal history.</p>
